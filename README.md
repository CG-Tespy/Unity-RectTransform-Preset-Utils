# Unity-RectTransform-Preset-Utils
Allows you to set the anchor presets in code, with the same results you'd get messing with the Rect Transform's inspector controls.

How to use:

1 - Import the test project unity package, at least the scripts in it.

2 - In your own code, just call the ApplyAnchorPreset function on a rectTransform of your choosing (it's an extension method).

 2a - Keep in mind that function is in the CGTespy.UI namespace.
 
3 - Have fun!
